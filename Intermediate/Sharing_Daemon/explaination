I created a docker file.
First of all I chosed Alpine as a base image.
And then I executed it and install the docker in the shell,
and got this error "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock."

And then I use -v tag,
docker run --name bakar1 -dit -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock bakar

And the docker was installed.
lasty I updated the docker file
